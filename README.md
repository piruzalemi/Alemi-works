Please Make a note of the following:

1. I have provided screen shots of the beginning and endings summaries for each year of 2014, 2015 & 2016

2. Bonus Shot screen, captures the greatest and least values for all of 2014-2016. The program can be easily modified to capture
   the greatest for each year, by writing the same logic of finding the Greatest within the loop of Work Sheets rather than outside of it.

3. I have identified the Tickers where a full year of data is not provided. See Column of number of days.
   I have easily could have added a note next to those days that were < 365 or < 364  days. I also could have been more accurate
   by considering leap years. I have not done so, solely because i need to focus on Python rather than VB. 

4. The final loop across all the sheets required me to change Next to Next WS. This made a big difference in the results.

5. I have added some comments in the code for readibility. Hope it makes my code more clear.

6. I hope this work meets the requirements. My focus is really Python. If you wish me to improve or make additional changes let me know as i still have 
   two extra days to complete the assignment. But it would be great if i could focus all my efforts on Python, which is really key for me.

   Thank you all the TAs for your generous help. You have been absolutely great and I truly appreciate every one of your helps. Thank You and enjoy.
   Respectfully,

   Piruz Alemi.
